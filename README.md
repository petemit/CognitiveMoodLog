# Cognitive Mood Log (CBT Pal)
There are a lot of CBT apps on the market, but I wanted to have an app with just the questions I wanted to ask designed in a way that made sense to me.  CBT Pal has several cognitive distortions and you are able to describe them with different emotions and then compare your emotions before and after to see if you were able to address some of these emotions by processing a particular incident.

## Technologies used
* For the DB Layer I chose to use Realm as I wanted a cross-platform (supports iOS) DBMS.
* I use the MVVM architecture throughout
* Kotlin

## Future goals
* In the future I think I would make the DB layer Kotlin Multiplatform so I can share the business logic layer.
